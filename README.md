# Scoot-Project

## About the project

We had to reproduce a website model and thus also produce its versions for tablet and mobile support. 
We had to do this work in a duo with a colleague from the training. 

## Learning objectives

 - Consolidate your knowledges in GIT, HTML, CSS (SASS), JS.
 - Respect the given design and deliver pixel perfect content.
 - Work in a team.
 - Respect the given deadline.
 - Divide work in smaller parts.

### The design

Here you'll find the **[FIGMA FILE](coach.md)**

Thanks to Figma, you can click and select different elements of the model and have an indication of each of them in the right column.
