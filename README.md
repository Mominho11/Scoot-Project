# Scoot-Project

## About the project

We had to reproduce a website model and also make its tablet and mobile versions. 
We had to do this work in duo with a colleague from the training. 

## Learning objectives

 - Divide work in smaller parts.

### The design

Here you'll find the **[FIGMA FILE](coach.md)**

Thanks to Figma, you can click and select different elements of the model and have an indication of each of them in the right column.
